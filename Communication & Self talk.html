                answers: [
                    { text: "Just stop and catch your breath without saying anything, hoping the coach notices.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Stopping abruptly sends mixed signals and disrupts the flow. **Functional communication** is clear, controlled, and respectful of the coach's plan." },
                    { text: "Say: 'Coach, I need a 30-second reset. I'll be back on the line for the next rep.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **functional and controlled self-expression**. It states a clear, time-bound need without making excuses, showing you manage your energy autonomously." },
                    { text: "Say: 'This set is too hard! I can't keep going.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This phrase expresses frustration, not a plan. **Self-control** means replacing complaints with a clear, positive action plan." },
                    { text: "Try to push through the fatigue, but slow down significantly, hoping no one notices.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Slowing down without communication is passive. **Communication** ensures everyone is on the same page and helps you reset effectively." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 2: It's the start of a final race, and you feel intense anxiety. What piece of self-talk is most effective right now?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Tell yourself: 'Don't mess up the start. Don't look at the competitors.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Focusing on 'don't' emphasizes the mistake and increases anxiety. **Positive self-talk** should focus on desired action." },
                    { text: "Say: 'I need to win this race for my coach and family.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This focuses on the external **outcome** and adds unnecessary pressure. Self-talk should focus on the **process** you control." },
                    { text: "Say: 'I've trained for this moment. Focus on my first three strides and trust my speed.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **process-focused, positive self-talk**. It acknowledges preparation and directs your energy to a simple, actionable cue, managing anxiety successfully." },
                    { text: "Remind yourself of all the hard workouts you did to get here.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "While positive, this is passive reflection. **Self-talk** is most effective when it's an active, forward-moving instruction." }

                question: "Scenario 3: You foul a critical throw or botch a long jump approach. You feel a burst of frustration. How should you express and manage this emotion?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Scream briefly or throw your towel down to get the frustration out.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "External outbursts waste energy and focus. **Self-control** means acknowledging the emotion and containing it quickly." },
                    { text: "Walk away, use one strong cue word (like 'Flush!'), and immediately focus on the next rep's purpose.", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This uses a controlled, **functional cue** to signal the emotional reset. It shows you can express the emotion by moving past it and returning to the task at hand." },
                    { text: "Ignore the feeling completely and try to pretend you aren't frustrated.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Suppressing emotion doesn't work; it often builds up. **Self-expression** is healthier when it's acknowledged and then intentionally redirected." },
                    { text: "Immediately start analyzing the mistake in your mind before the coach can talk to you.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Analysis needs to wait for the proper time. Immediately after an error, the focus must be on **emotional reset**." }

            {
                question: "Scenario 4: You feel a sharp, unusual pain in your knee during a long run. What is the clearest way to communicate this need to stop to your coach?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Keep running and try to minimize the pain, hoping it goes away on its own.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This risks injury. **Self-advocacy** means prioritizing safety and communicating issues immediately, not pushing through sharp pain." },
                    { text: "Stop and say: 'Coach, I think I pulled something. I'm going to take a break.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This uses speculation ('I think I pulled something'). **Clear communication** should be factual, focusing on the sensation and location, not a diagnosis." },
                    { text: "Stop immediately and say, 'Coach, I have a sharp pain in my knee, and I need to stop running right now.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is the ideal **clear, factual communication**. It states the location and the nature of the pain directly, allowing the coach to make an informed safety decision." },
                    { text: "Run over to a teammate and explain the pain to them first.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Communicate directly with the person who needs to know for your safety (the coach)." }

            {
                question: "Scenario 5: Your coach explains a new, complex training drill, but you are confused about the footwork. How should you functionally ask for clarification?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Just nod and pretend you understand to avoid looking slow in front of others.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Pretending ensures you execute the drill incorrectly, which wastes everyone's time. **Self-advocacy** means asking when you need help." },
                    { text: "Ask: 'Coach, can you walk me through that footwork again slowly? I want to make sure I execute it perfectly.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **functional questioning**. It frames the request around a positive goal (perfect execution), making the request specific and proactive." },
                    { text: "Ask: 'I don't get it. Can someone else explain the drill to me?'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This expresses frustration and asks someone else to do the coach's job. Keep your **communication** respectful and direct." },
                    { text: "Wait for a teammate to ask the question, then listen to the answer.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Waiting is passive. **Autonomy** means taking responsibility for your own understanding." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 6: Mid-repetition, your legs start burning, and your mind tells you to stop. What is the best instructional self-talk to push through the discomfort?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Yell out loud: 'Why is this so painful?'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Asking a philosophical question mid-rep doesn't help execution. **Self-talk** needs to be an instruction." },
                    { text: "Mentally use the phrase: 'Slow down a little, I deserve a break.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This is negative self-talk that gives yourself permission to fail the objective. **Discipline** is maintained through strong internal instruction." },
                    { text: "Mentally use a process cue: 'Knees high. Drive forward. Fight for five more seconds.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is highly effective **instructional self-talk**. It directs your focus to a physical cue, maintaining form and discipline until the finish." },
                    { text: "Start counting how many steps are left until you can stop.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Counting encourages distraction and focusing on the finish line rather than the quality of the current moment." }

            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 7: Your coach stops practice to give you sharp, critical feedback on a technical error you just made. How should you respond with self-control?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Immediately argue back and defend why you did it that way.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Defensiveness prevents learning. **Self-control** means listening and processing the technical information first." },
                    { text: "Say: 'Got it. I hear the technical point. I will focus on that exact change in the next rep.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is the **functional response**. It acknowledges the critique, separates the technical point from emotion, and commits to a specific future action." },
                    { text: "Stare at the ground and nod silently, feeling embarrassed.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Silent nodding is unclear. **Communication** requires active acknowledgment to ensure the message was received and understood." },
                    { text: "Ask the coach to explain why the feedback was so harsh.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Focusing on the *tone* (harshness) distracts from the *content* (the technique). Keep the conversation focused on performance." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 8: Just before your event, a distraction (e.g., loud music, a commentator) breaks your focus. How do you use self-talk to restore your concentration?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Yell at the distraction (the music or person) to be quiet.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "You can't control external factors. **Self-management** is about controlling your internal world." },
                    { text: "Use a simple cue word and mentally repeat: 'My bubble. My space. I control my focus.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **self-management** through self-talk. It uses a strong, protective phrase to actively block the distraction and anchor your mind internally." },
                    { text: "Wait for the distraction to pass, and only resume your routine when it's completely quiet.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This gives the distraction control over your routine. **Resilience** means proceeding regardless of outside factors." },
                    { text: "Try to visualize your best previous performance to regain confidence.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Visualization might be too passive. You need an active self-talk command to block the noise and regain control." }
                ]
            },
            {
                question: "Scenario 9: You miss a new personal record (PR) by a tiny margin and feel crushing disappointment. What is the most constructive self-talk?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Tell yourself: 'I'll never hit that goal if I keep making small mistakes.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This is catastrophizing. **Constructive self-talk** is forward-looking and based on facts, not hyperbole." },
                    { text: "Say: 'That effort was solid. What is one technical thing I can adjust and try next time?'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is ideal **self-reflection**. It acknowledges the positive effort while immediately shifting focus from the crushing outcome to a clear, actionable **process goal**." },
                    { text: "Tell yourself to forget it happened and immediately think about something else.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "You must first process the emotion and capture the learning. **Reflection** is crucial before moving on." },
                    { text: "Complain to a teammate about how unfair the conditions were today.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Blaming external factors avoids taking responsibility for self-improvement." }

            {
                question: "Scenario 10: Your relay team is struggling with handoffs because everyone is quiet. What is the most assertive and constructive communication to the team?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Say: 'We are messing this up! We all need to communicate better.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This is vague and focuses on the problem ('messing up'). **Constructive communication** is specific and solution-oriented." },
                    { text: "Say: 'Let's all state one specific thing we'll commit to on the exchange. I'll focus on my mark.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is **assertive and collaborative**. It requests specific, actionable commitment from everyone, making the communication functional and effective." },
                    { text: "Ask: 'Is anyone else nervous about the handoffs? I know I am.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This focuses on shared anxiety, not the mechanical fix. **Team communication** must drive action." },
                    { text: "Wait for the coach to interrupt and solve the problem for the team.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This relies on external authority. **Autonomy** means team members take ownership of their own communication issues." }

                answers: [
                    { text: "Mentally argue: 'I don't feel like training, but I have to do it.'", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Focusing on the negative (not feeling like it) drains energy. **Affirmation** must be positive and strong." },
                    { text: "Mentally use the phrase: 'I choose to be here. This hard work is how I get stronger.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is a powerful **affirmation of commitment**. It asserts control (I choose) and links the current discomfort to the long-term, positive goal (getting stronger)." },
                    { text: "Think about the last time you missed a workout and felt guilty.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Guilt is negative motivation. **Positive self-talk** uses goals and commitment, not fear of failure." },
                    { text: "Only do the warm-up, and see if you feel like training after that.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "This compromises the session before it starts. **Commitment** is about showing up and starting with full intent." }

                answers: [
                    { text: "Skip the extra session and avoid the coach on the way out.", isCorrect: false, explanation: "Skipping without communication is disrespectful and passive. **Assertiveness** requires clear communication." },
                    { text: "Say: 'Coach, I appreciate the opportunity, but I need to stick to my planned recovery today for long-term health and injury prevention.'", isCorrect: true, explanation: "This is ideal **self-advocacy**.
